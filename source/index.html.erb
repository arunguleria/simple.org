    <p class="intro">The fast, free app for clinicians to track patients with hypertension.</p>

    <h3>What is Simple?</h3>
    <p>In many places, patient records for blood pressure measurements are unusable for longitudinal care. A simple, focused tracking system, coupled with a simple and effective treatment protocol, will help clinicians to save patients’ lives.</p>

    <h3>Where did this project start?</h3>
    <p>Simple was initiated by not-for-profit Resolve to Save Lives (an initiative of Vital Strategies), which aims to reduce the number of people dying from heart disease and stroke in low- and  middle-income countries. A key goal is to dramatically increase the percentage of people with hypertension who have their blood pressure measured and controlled. Simple, contextual digital platforms for tracking hypertension are essential, enabling actionable reporting and improved patient management.</p>

    <h3>What’s the roadmap?</h3>
    <p>We are at an early stage. Prototypes of an app were tested in Punjab with the <a href="http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=173938">India Hypertension Management Initiative</a> (IHMI) in April 2018 and we are close to testing a minimum viable product in the field in July.</p>
    <p>We can envision a future where we work closely with the ministries of health in many countries and in appropriate situations  this app will be used in clinical care settings. Robust reporting tools will be built to track clinic and regional control of hypertension. And we are likely to create tools to help patients track their personal blood pressures.
      That said, it’s early days and we will be guided by lessons learned on the ground and by guidance from all of those involved in the project.</p>
