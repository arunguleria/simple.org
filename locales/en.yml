  whatQ: "What is Simple?"
  whatA: "Simple is an Android app that helps improve hypertension control and prevent heart attacks and strokes by making it easy for healthcare workers to manage blood pressure (BP) measurements and medications. A web-based Simple dashboard gives health system managers the feedback they need to improve BP control across their facilities. "

  startA: "Simple is supported by <a href=\"https://www.resolvetosavelives.org\">Resolve to Save Lives</a>, an initiative of the not-for-profit <a href=\"https://www.vitalstrategies.org/\">Vital Strategies</a>, which aims to reduce the number of people dying from heart disease and strokes in low- and middle-income countries. A key goal is to dramatically increase the number of people with hypertension who have their blood pressure measured and controlled. Simple, contextual digital platforms for managing hypertension are essential to enable actionable reporting and improve patient management."

We are learning from these active deployments and we are expanding to more clinics and other states."
